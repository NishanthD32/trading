    <h1><b>The Basics of Day Trading</b></h1><br/>
    <p>Day trading means buying and selling a batch of securities within a day, or even within <br/>seconds. It has nothing to do with investing in the traditional sense. It is exploiting the<br/> inevitable up-and-down price movements that occur during a trading session.</p> &nbsp;
    <p>Day trading is most common in the stock markets and on the foreign exchange (forex) <br/>where currencies are traded.</p> &nbsp;
    <p>Day traders are typically well-educated in the minutia of trading and tend to be well<br/> funded. Many of them add an additional level of risk by using leverage to increase the size of<br/> their stakes.</p>&nbsp;
    <p>Day traders are attuned to events that cause short-term market moves. Trading based on <br/>the news is one popular technique. Scheduled announcements such as the release of economic statistics,<br/> corporate earnings, or interest rate announcements are subject to market <br/>expectations and market psychology. That is, markets react when those expectations are not met or <br/>are exceeded—usually with sudden, significant moves which can greatly benefit day traders.</p>&nbsp;
    <h1><b>Why Day Trading Is Controversial</b></h1>&nbsp;
    <p>The profit potential of day trading is an oft-debated topic on Wall Street. Internet<br/> day-trading scams have lured amateurs by promising enormous returns in a short period of time.</p>&nbsp;
    <p>Some people day-trade without sufficient knowledge. But there are day traders who make a <br/>successful living despite—or perhaps because of—the risks.</p>&nbsp;
    <p>Many professional money managers and financial advisors shy away from day trading. They<br/> argue that, in most cases, the reward does not justify the risk. Moreover, many economists and <br/>financial practitioners argue that active trading strategies of any kind tend to underperform <br/>a more basic passive index strategy over time especially after fees and taxes are taken into account.</p>&nbsp;
    <h1><b>How Does a Day Trader Get Started?</b></h1>&nbsp;
    <p>Professional day traders—those who trade for a living rather than as a hobby—are typically<br/> well established in the field.
